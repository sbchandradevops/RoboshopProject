# Developer has chosen the database MongoDB. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

# HINT
# Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.
# Developer has shared the version information as MongoDB-4.x
script_location=$(pwd)

cp ${script_location}/Files/mongo.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo

# Setup the MongoDB repo file

# Install MongoDB

dnf install mongodb-org -y

# Start & Enable MongoDB Service

systemctl enable mongod
systemctl start mongod

# Usually MongoDB opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application
# that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server,
# So we need to change the config accordingly.

# Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/mongod.conf
# Just check to replace the address by typing sudo cat /etc/mongod.conf
sed -i -e 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' /etc/mongod.conf

# Restart the service to make the changes effected.
systemctl restart mongod
